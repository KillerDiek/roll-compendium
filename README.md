# Roll Compendium

Roll Compendium is a Foundry VTT module designed to simplify the process for creating roll tables from Compendiums allowing for random item rolls without importing every item from a Compendium. If you've ever had to manually create Roll Tables spanning multiple Compendiums, then this module is for you, and I'm also very sorry.
## Usage

Roll Compendium will create a new button in the header section of the Roll Tables Directory, from there, usage is as simple as clicking the button and selecting which Compendiums/Items to import and clicking import.

#### Warning: As of now, Roll Compendium is rather computationally intensive. No, you're computer did not break, hopefully. Optimizations are coming but for now the current version works.
## Installation

Copy and paste the following Manifest URL into the Manifest URL entry box in Foundry:

## Features

- You can import multiple Compendiums into one table, how neat is that?
